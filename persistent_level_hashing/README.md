# Persistent Level Hashing 

The code for persistent level hashing, run in the simulated NVM platform, i.e., [Quartz](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/quartz).

## How to run

1.  Build the Quartz emulator;
2.  Change the `path-to-pmalloc.h-in-Quartz` in `log.h` to yours;
3.  Copy the `libnvmemul.so` file generated by your Quartz into this folder;
4.  Do `make` to generate an executable file `plevel`;
5.  Run `plevel` in Quartz: `scripts/runenv.sh <your_app>`;    

**Note:** In the current implementation, we add logging operations when insertions trigger movements, which is different from the implementation presented in our paper. By doing so, deletions and updates do not need to check duplicate items. As movements are not frequent, logging has a negligible impact on the insertion performance.
